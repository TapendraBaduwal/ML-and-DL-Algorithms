Machine learning can automatically analyze millions of data in a few minutes.\n","\n","* Machine learning text classification based on real-time analysis.\n","\n","\n","\n","**Text Classification Examples:**\n","\n","* **Sentiment Analysis:**Sentiment analysis allows you to automatically analyze all forms of text for the feeling and emotion of the writer.\n","\n","* **Topic Labeling:**\n","Another common example of text classification is topic labeling, that is, understanding what a given text is talking about.\n","\n","* **Language Detection:**\n","Language detection is another great example of text classification, that is, the process of classifying incoming text according to its language.\n","\n","* **Intent Detection:**\n","Intent detection or intent classification is another great use case for text classification that analyzes text to understand the reason behind feedback. Maybe it’s a complaint, or maybe a customer is expressing intent to purchase a product.\n","\n","\n","**Text Classification Applications & Use Cases:**\n","\n","\n","Some of the top applications and use cases of text classification include:\n","\n","* Automate business processes\n","\n","* Email spam filtering\n","\n","* Detecting urgent issues\n","\n","* Automating customer support processes\n","\n","* Listening to the Voice of customer (VoC)\n","\n","* Phising and nonphising classification\n","\n","\n","\n","#**Text classification using K-means Clustering Algorithm:**\n","\n","Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique which means that it has no labeled data and grouping a set of object having similar feature to each other.One of the most popular an simple clustering algorithms is k-means clustering algorithm.\n","\n","\n","K-Means is one of the simplest unsupervised clustering algorithm which is used to cluster our data into K number of clusters.
