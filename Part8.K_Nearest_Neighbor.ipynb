point into the category that is most similar to the old available  data categories.**\n","\n","- KNN is also called a **lazy learner** because when we supply training data to this algorithm, the **algorithm does not train itself and it does not do any calculations at this time**, at first it stores the dataset and **at the time of classification of new unseen data points it performs an calculations action on the dataset.**\n","\n","- KNN algorithm **at the training phase just stores the dataset** and when it gets new data, then it classifies that data into a category that is much
